# bit-split

A Java implementation of the Bit-Splitting algorithm. 

The algorithm was first introduced in [A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1431550) and continued in [Performance of FPGA implementation of bit-split architecture for intrusion detection systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1639434). 

This implementation generates DOT graphs for the examples given in both papers.
